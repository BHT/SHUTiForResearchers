# SHUTi for Researchers

This github page houses an R Markdown document & accompanying syntax that was developed by the SHUTi for Researchers team to ensure that all SHUTi users compute sleep diary variables in the same way. You will at times need to edit the syntax where directed; however, please DO NOT alter the formulas or reuse the syntax without permission of the SHUTi for Researchers team. 

Before you begin, please first read through the PDF document of the RMarkdown code. Focus on the directions between the 'chunks' of syntax code, and look out for places where you will need to modify the code based on idiosyncracies of your data and files (denoted with "##EDITING (MAY BE) REQUIRED" tags). 

IMPORTANT NOTE: We may periodically update this document. To ensure that you are using the most up-to-date syntax, confirm that your file name matches the following: "Sleep Diary Syntax_GitHub_v1.RMD" / "Sleep Diary Syntax_GitHub_v1.PDF." Individual researchers are responsible for updating their syntax version in parallel with updates to this page.

Finally, for those interested in learning more about the function of individual lines of code, please contact the SHUTi for Researchers team, who can share a more extensively commented version of the general syntax.

We hope that the syntax we have prepared substantially reduces the time needed to manage your SHUTi diary data and compute your diary outcomes. Please site this page in any work that leverages aspects of that which we share here.
