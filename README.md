# Sleep Diary Data - Formatting and Outcomes Computation for SHUTi for Researchers

This github page houses an R Markdown file with directions and syntax that was developed by the SHUTi for Researchers team to ensure that all SHUTi users compute sleep diary variables in the same way. You will at times need to edit the syntax where directed; however, please DO NOT alter the formulas or reuse the syntax without permission of the SHUTi for Researchers team. 

Before you begin, we recommend that you first read through the PDF document of the RMarkdown code. Focus on the directions between the 'chunks' of syntax code, and look out for places where you will need to modify the code based on idiosyncracies of your data and files (denoted with "##EDITING (MAY BE) REQUIRED" tags). You may also wish to review the companion manuscript, which details and provides justification for the overall SHUTi sleep diary data management process (available at: https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsad199 ; authors' copy of the accepted manuscript saved in this repository ["SLEEP_Shaffer 2023_Online Sleep Diaries_share.pdf"]).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** We may periodically update this file. To ensure that you are using the most up-to-date syntax, confirm that your file name matches the following: "Sleep Diary Syntax_GitHub_v3.RMD" / "Sleep Diary Syntax_GitHub_v3.PDF." Individual researchers are responsible for updating their syntax version in parallel with updates to this page. Changes between versions are logged of in the "Sleep Diary Syntax Updates.docx" document.

Finally, for those interested in learning more about the function of individual lines of code, please contact the SHUTi for Researchers team, who can share a more extensively commented version of the general syntax.

We hope that the syntax we have prepared substantially reduces the time needed to manage your SHUTi diary data and compute your diary outcomes. For any presentations or published works that leverages files shared here, please cite this GitHub page:
